# Weather Data Visualizer – Mini Project  
### Programming for Problem Solving using Python  
### Lab Assignment 4 – Complete OOP Solution

This mini project analyzes real-world weather data using Python.  
It demonstrates data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, grouping, export, and storytelling.  
The project fulfills **ALL requirements** of Lab Assignment 4.

## 📌 Project Overview

Climate awareness is increasingly important today.  
This project visualizes weather patterns such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity to understand short-term and seasonal trends.

The program:

- Creates a sample weather dataset (CSV)
- Loads and inspects the data (head, info, describe)
- Cleans missing values and converts date formats
- Computes statistics using **NumPy**
- Generates required charts using **Matplotlib**
- Groups data by **month** and **season**
- Exports cleaned CSV + PNG plot images
- Generates an automated **Markdown weather report**

All tasks are performed automatically in **one Python file** using a simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach.

## 📁 Files Generated by the Program

After running the script, the following files are created:

### **CSV Files**
- `weather_data.csv` — Raw sample dataset  
- `weather_data_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned and processed dataset  

### **Plots (PNG Images)**  
Stored inside `/outputs/` folder:
- `temperature_line.png` — Line chart of daily temperature  
- `rainfall_bar.png` — Monthly rainfall totals  
- `humidity_temperature_scatter.png` — Humidity vs temperature scatter plot  
- `combined_plot.png` — Temperature + rainfall combined figure  

### **Report**
- `weather_report.md` — Storytelling-style insights report
